Welcome to this kind of mind experiment.

Well i came here for a little experiment. What if there is escape from reality?You know what i mean? Only one gate that happens to be the most dangerous thing you ever heard of. Unlimited potential after you cross this gate.That one thing i'm realy scared of.U know what i mean?Basicly i'm scared of drugs.Everything i'm scared of is that after i will smoke marryjane is that i will never get back. Cause there is mysticism to this drug. Only those who tryed it know what can happen.Maybe i will know that once but i'm scared
WHAT WILL HAPPEN WILL HAPPEN. :'(
WWHWH
Can i escape reality?
